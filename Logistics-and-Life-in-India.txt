# Context: Practical Logistics and Student Life in India for Bangladeshi Students

## 1. Pre-Departure Checklist
- **Document Attestation:** Get all academic marksheets and certificates attested by the Bangladesh Ministry of Education and Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
- **Visa Application:** Start the visa process at least 1-2 months before the planned travel date.
- **Packing:** Pack for varying weather conditions (hot summers, mild winters in Delhi-NCR), traditional attire for cultural events, and any specific personal items.
- **Currency:** Carry some initial cash in INR for immediate expenses upon arrival.

## 2. Post-Arrival Formalities
- **FRRO Registration:** This is mandatory for all international students. Within 14 days of arrival, students must register with the Foreigners Regional Registration Office (FRRO). University International Offices provide full assistance for this process.
- **SIM Card:** A local Indian SIM card can be easily obtained at the airport or near campus using the passport and visa as proof of identity.
- **Bank Account:** Students can open a bank account in India. The university's bonafide certificate and proof of address (from the hostel) are usually required.

## 3. Student Life and Cultural Adjustment
- **Food:** While hostel messes provide standard Indian food, most campuses have canteens with diverse options. Areas around universities in Noida/Greater Noida have many restaurants, including some offering Halal food. Finding authentic Bangladeshi cuisine can be challenging, but Bengali restaurants are available in Delhi.
- **Transport:** Local transport includes auto-rickshaws, ride-sharing apps (Uber, Ola), and the Delhi Metro, which is an efficient way to travel around the NCR.
- **Safety:** It is advisable to be cautious, especially when traveling at night. Always use trusted transport and travel in groups when possible. All listed university campuses are highly secure with 24/7 surveillance.
- **Community:** All universities have a significant Bangladeshi student community, which provides a strong support network for new students.
