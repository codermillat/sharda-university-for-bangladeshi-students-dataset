## Category 1: Admissions, Scholarships, and Agents

**Question 1: Are the scholarships real or just a marketing gimmick? How do I actually apply for one?**
- **Answer:** The scholarships are real and are a core part of the admission policy for many private universities like Sharda, Galgotias, and Amity. The process is straightforward:
  1.  **Automatic Assessment:** You do not need to fill out a separate scholarship application. The university automatically assesses your eligibility based on your HSC or Diploma results (CGPA/percentage) that you submit with your admission application.
  2.  **Official Confirmation:** The scholarship percentage you have been awarded will be clearly stated in the **Provisional Offer Letter** sent by the university. This letter is your official proof.
  3.  **Continuation:** Be aware of the continuation criteria. You must maintain a certain CGPA and have a minimum of 75% attendance each year to keep the scholarship for the entire duration of your course.

**Question 2: How do I know if an education agent in Bangladesh is official? I'm worried about fraud.**
- **Answer:** This is a valid concern. The safest way to verify an agent is to **contact the university's International Admissions Office directly** via their official email or phone number. Ask them for a list of their authorized representatives in Bangladesh.
- **Warning Signs of Unofficial Agents:**
  - They ask for large amounts of cash for "application processing" instead of directing you to pay the official university fees through proper channels.
  - They promise a guaranteed visa or scholarship without seeing your documents.
  - They discourage you from contacting the university directly.

**Question 3: What are the "hidden costs" besides the tuition fee?**
- **Answer:** It's important to budget for costs beyond just tuition. The main additional costs are:
  1.  **One-Time Fees:** A non-refundable admission fee and a refundable security deposit are charged in the first year (e.g., Sharda's is ~₹52,000).
  2.  **Hostel and Mess Fees:** This is a major annual expense, ranging from ₹1,00,000 to ₹1,80,000 per year depending on the university and room type (AC/Non-AC).
  3.  **Examination Fees:** Universities charge a separate fee per semester for conducting exams.
  4.  **Living Expenses:** Budget for personal expenses like local travel, mobile bills, and eating out, which can be around ₹5,000 - ₹8,000 per month.

## Category 2: Visa, Legal Formalities, and Finances

**Question 4: Do I really need a bank statement for the Indian student visa? Some agents say it's not needed.**
- **Answer:** This is a critical point. While the university admission process itself does not require a bank statement, the **Indian High Commission's visa application process generally does**.
- **Guidance:** You should prepare a bank statement showing a balance of at least **BDT 1,00,000**. This is not for paying fees but to demonstrate to the visa officer that you have sufficient funds to cover your living expenses in India. The university's letters are for proving your admission, but the bank statement proves your financial stability.

**Question 5: What is FRRO registration? Is it very complicated?**
- **Answer:** FRRO (Foreigners Regional Registration Office) registration is a **mandatory legal requirement**. You must register online within **14 days of your arrival** in India.
- **Process:** The process is entirely online. The most important document you need is a **C-Form**, which is provided by your accommodation provider (hostel warden or landlord).
- **Solution:** This process is made very easy by the universities. The International Relations Department (IRD) at Sharda, Amity, and other universities provides **full assistance**. They will help you get the required Bonafide Certificate and C-Form and guide you through the entire online application. Do not worry about this, but do not delay it.

**Question 6: How do I pay my fees from Bangladesh? Can I use bKash?**
- **Answer:** You cannot use mobile banking services like bKash for international tuition fees. The official and safest methods are:
  1.  **Student File (Bank):** Open a "student file" at a commercial bank in Bangladesh (like Eastern Bank Ltd. or City Bank). You submit your university's offer letter, and the bank will legally remit the fees directly to the university's account in India.
  2.  **Direct Wire Transfer (TT):** Your parents can also wire transfer the funds directly from their bank account.
  3.  **Payment Gateways:** Some universities like Amity use international payment services like Flywire, which allow you to pay using a Bangladeshi credit card or bank transfer.

## Category 3: Academic and Campus Life

**Question 7: Is the 75% attendance rule really strict?**
- **Answer:** Yes, absolutely. This is a rule set by the Indian University Grants Commission (UGC) and is strictly enforced by all universities. If your attendance falls below 75%, you will be barred from sitting for your final semester exams, leading to a backlog. It is also a condition for continuing your scholarship.

**Question 8: What happens if I fail a subject? Will I be kicked out?**
- **Answer:** No, you will not be kicked out. Failing a subject is called a "backlog." You will have to appear for a re-examination for that subject in a later semester. You must pay a fee for each backlog exam. However, having a backlog will result in the **discontinuation of your merit scholarship** for the following academic year. You must clear all backlogs to receive your final degree.

**Question 9: Is it safe for Bangladeshi students, especially girls? What about ragging?**
- **Answer:** All the universities listed (Sharda, Amity, Galgotias, NIU, G.L. Bajaj) have highly secure, closed campuses with 24/7 security and CCTV surveillance. They all have a **zero-tolerance policy against ragging**, with strict anti-ragging committees. Sharda University, for example, highlights that it has 43% female students, indicating a safe and inclusive environment. General caution is always advised when traveling outside the campus.

**Question 10: Will I get food like in Bangladesh? Are Halal options available?**
- **Answer:** You will not find authentic Bangladeshi cuisine in the hostel mess. The mess typically serves North Indian vegetarian and non-vegetarian food. However, most major universities have **Halal food counters** in their canteens. The large Bangladeshi student communities also help newcomers find places with suitable food options.

## Category 4: Career and Post-Graduation

**Question 11: Can I work part-time in India while studying?**
- **Answer:** Legally, a student on an Indian Student Visa is **not permitted to work off-campus**. However, some universities offer paid on-campus opportunities like research assistantships, library work, or roles in campus events. For internships, the university provides official letters to the company, which makes it permissible.

**Question 12: Is my degree from an Indian private university valid in Bangladesh and other countries?**
- **Answer:** Yes. A degree from a UGC-recognized and NAAC-accredited university like Sharda, Amity, or Galgotias is valid globally. For the degree to be officially recognized for government jobs or further studies in Bangladesh, you need to get it **attested**. The process involves getting an attestation from the Indian Ministry of External Affairs in New Delhi, followed by the Bangladesh High Commission in New Delhi.
