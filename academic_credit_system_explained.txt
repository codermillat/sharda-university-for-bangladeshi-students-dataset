## 1. Information Gap: Exact Credits Not Provided in Source Materials

The promotional brochures, fee structures, and videos provided do not contain the specific total number of credits for each individual undergraduate or postgraduate program. This level of detail is typically found in the official, in-depth syllabus or course structure documents published by the university for each specific department.

Therefore, this context file provides a **general and highly reliable framework** based on the standard guidelines from the University Grants Commission (UGC) and the All India Council for Technical Education (AICTE), which all the listed institutions follow.

## 3. How Credits are Calculated (L-T-P Structure)

The Indian credit system is based on the **L-T-P structure**, which stands for:
- **L (Lecture):** 1 hour of lecture per week = 1 credit.
- **T (Tutorial):** 1 hour of tutorial/discussion class per week = 1 credit.
- **P (Practical/Lab):** 2 hours of practical or lab work per week = 1 credit.

A typical 4-credit course might have a structure of 3-1-0 (3 lectures, 1 tutorial, 0 practicals) or 3-0-2 (3 lectures, 0 tutorials, 2 hours of practicals). The total credits for a degree are the sum of the credits of all the courses (core, elective, and practicals) completed over the entire duration.
