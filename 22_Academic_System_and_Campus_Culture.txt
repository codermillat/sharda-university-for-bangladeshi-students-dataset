# Context: Details on the Indian Academic System and Campus Culture.

## 1. Academic System Explained
- **Grading System:** India primarily uses a 10-point grading system.
  - **SGPA (Semester Grade Point Average):** The grade point average for a single semester.
  - **CGPA (Cumulative Grade Point Average):** The overall grade point average across all completed semesters.
- **Attendance Policy:** A minimum of **75% attendance** is a strict mandatory requirement in most Indian universities, including Sharda. Failure to meet this can result in being barred from sitting for final exams. This rule is also tied to scholarship continuation.
- **Backlogs/Re-examinations:** If a student fails a subject, it is called a "backlog" or "back paper." They must clear it by appearing for a re-examination in a subsequent semester. Clearing all backlogs is necessary to be awarded the final degree.

## 2. Social and Cultural Life
- **Student Clubs and Societies:** Universities have numerous student-run clubs for activities like debate, photography, music, dance, coding, and entrepreneurship.
- **Major Campus Festivals:** Students will experience major Indian festivals celebrated on campus, such as **Holi** (the festival of colors) and **Diwali** (the festival of lights). Universities often host large-scale cultural fests, like Sharda's "Chorus."
- **Bangladeshi Student Associations:** Most universities with a significant number of Bangladeshi students have informal or formal student associations. These groups celebrate national days like Pohela Boishakh and International Mother Language Day (Ekushey February) and provide a strong community support system.
- **Food Culture:** While hostel food is standard, students can explore a vast variety of North Indian street food and restaurant cuisines in the areas surrounding the campus.
