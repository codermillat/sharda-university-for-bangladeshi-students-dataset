# Context: Practical Guide for Pre-Departure Preparations and First-Day Arrival Logistics.

## 1. Health and Medical Preparations
- **Medical Check-up:** While not always mandatory for the visa, a basic health check-up is recommended before leaving Bangladesh.
- **Vaccinations:** Check for any recommended vaccinations for travel to India.
- **Health Insurance:** The initial admission fee paid to the university includes a health insurance policy for the first year. This policy typically covers medical emergencies and hospitalization at the on-campus Sharda Hospital and other network hospitals. Students should clarify the coverage details upon arrival.

## 2. Travel and Arrival Logistics
- **Travel to Campus:**
  - **From Delhi Airport (Indira Gandhi International Airport - IGI):** The distance to Greater Noida is approx. 52 km.
  - **Options:**
    1.  **University Pickup:** The university's International Relations Department (IRD) can arrange for airport pickup if coordinated in advance. This is the safest and most recommended option for first-time arrivals.
    2.  **Pre-paid Taxi:** Use the official pre-paid taxi counters inside the airport terminal to avoid being overcharged.
    3.  **Ride-Sharing Apps:** Uber and Ola are widely available.
    4.  **Metro:** A cost-effective but more complex option for a first-timer with luggage. It involves taking the Airport Express Line to a major station and then switching to the line that goes towards Noida/Greater Noida.

## 3. First Day on Campus: Reporting and Settling In
- **Reporting:** The first point of contact upon arrival is the **International Relations Department (IRD)** or the Admission Cell. They will guide the student through the final registration steps.
- **Hostel Check-in:** The IRD will facilitate the hostel allotment and check-in process.
- **Initial Setup:** The first few days will involve completing FRRO registration, opening a bank account, getting a local SIM card, and attending orientation programs. The IRD provides assistance for all these steps.
