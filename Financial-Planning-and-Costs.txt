## 2. Fee Payment Process from Bangladesh
- **Can fees be paid from Bangladesh?** Yes.
- **Channels:**
  - **Student File:** The most common and official method. Students open a student file at a Bangladeshi bank (e.g., Eastern Bank, City Bank). The university's offer letter and fee details are submitted, and the bank remits the fee directly to the university's account.
  - **Direct Wire Transfer (TT):** Parents/guardians can also directly wire transfer the funds to the university's account.
  - **Authorized Agents:** Some agents in Dhaka facilitate fee payments, but students should verify their authenticity with the university first.
- **Currency:** While fees are quoted in INR, payments from Bangladesh are typically processed in USD. The university provides the equivalent USD amount.

## 3. Financial Documentation for Visa
- **Bank Statement:** A bank statement showing a minimum balance of BDT 1,00,000 is a standard requirement for the Indian student visa application. This is to prove the student can cover their living expenses.
- **Sponsorship:** An Affidavit of Support from a parent or guardian is often required, stating they will cover all educational and living expenses.
