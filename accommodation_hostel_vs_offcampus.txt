# Context: A Guide to Accommodation for Bangladeshi Students

## 1. University Hostels (On-Campus)
- **Pros:**
  - **Safety & Security:** 24/7 security, CCTV surveillance, and strict in-times (usually around 9:30 PM - 10:00 PM) make it the safest option, especially for first-year students.
  - **Convenience:** Located on campus, saving travel time and cost. All facilities like mess, laundry, and academic blocks are within walking distance.
  - **Simplified Formalities:** The university handles the C-Form and provides the necessary address proof for FRRO and bank accounts.
- **Cons:**
  - **Cost:** Can be more expensive than some off-campus options.
  - **Food:** The mess food is typically North Indian cuisine, which may require an adjustment period.
- **Room Furnishings:** A standard hostel room includes a bed, mattress, study table, chair, and a cupboard. Students need to bring their own bedding (pillows, bedsheets) and personal items.

  - **Travel:** Incurs daily travel costs and time to get to the university.
- **Recommendation:** It is **highly recommended** for all first-year students to stay in the university hostel to ensure a smooth transition and completion of all legal formalities. They can explore off-campus options from the second year onwards if they wish.
