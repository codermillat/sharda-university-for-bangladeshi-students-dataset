# Context: Academic and Career Guidance for Bangladeshi Students

## 1. Understanding Key Indian Degrees
- **B.Tech vs. BCA/B.Sc. IT:**
  - **B.Tech (Bachelor of Technology):** A 4-year professional engineering degree. It is more rigorous, math-intensive, and hardware-oriented. It is generally considered the premier degree for core engineering and high-end tech roles.
  - **BCA/B.Sc. IT (Bachelor of Computer Applications / B.Sc. in IT):** A 3-year science/application-oriented degree. It focuses more on software development, programming languages, and IT applications. It is an excellent and faster route for careers in software development, web development, and IT services.
- **Lateral Entry for Diploma Holders:**
  - This is a significant advantage. A 3-year engineering diploma from Bangladesh is recognized for direct admission into the 2nd year of a B.Tech program in India. This saves the student one full year of study and fees.

## 2. Post-Graduation Opportunities in India
- **Post-Study Work Visa:** India does not have a standard post-study work visa program like Canada or the UK. After graduation, international students must secure a job offer to convert their student visa into an employment visa.
- **Job Market:** The IT and management sectors in India are vast. Students from top institutions like Amity, Galgotias, and G.L. Bajaj have a high chance of getting placed in major MNCs. The starting salary for a fresh B.Tech graduate can range from ₹4 Lakhs to ₹8 Lakhs per annum, and much higher for top performers.
- **Higher Studies:** A degree from a recognized Indian university (like those listed) is accepted globally for Master's and Ph.D. programs.

## 3. Internships and Part-Time Work
- **Internships:** Most professional courses (B.Tech, BBA, MBA) have mandatory internships. University placement cells actively help students secure these.
- **Part-Time Work:** Legally, students on an Indian Student Visa are **not permitted** to work off-campus. However, some universities offer paid on-campus opportunities like teaching assistantships, library work, or research assistant roles.
